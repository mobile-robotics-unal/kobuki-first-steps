¿Qué es un robot móvil? Definir qué es un robot y cuáles son sus principales características.

According to the ISO 8373:2012 standard. It is a robot which can move under its own control with or without manipulators. These robots are considered within the group of _"Service robots"_, these robots perform useful tasks for humans and equipment, except industrial automation applications _(R. Ramirez, 2024)_.

These robots are used in areas such as agriculture, food and beverage industry, exploration, health care, etc _(Devopedia, 2022)_ _(R. Ramirez, 2024)_.

## Features of a mobile robot.
These are the basic features that a mobile robot must incorporate to optimize the system to perform a task _(Devopedia, 2022)_. 

* Wireless communication.
* Fleet management software.
* Fleet simulation software.
* Integration with supervisory software.
  
These characteristics are essential, since they allow a efficient control of the tasks performed by the robot, check the status of the robot and, if it is necessary, an emergency stop and even remote operation of the robot in case of a failure. These activities are possible by implementing the appropriate firmware, controllers, sensors, mechanisms, and different types of hardware.

## Basic parts of a mobile robot.
A mobile robot mainly consists of five set of components such as:

* ****Controllers***: This component receives signals from sensors, actuators and processes different robot programming codes. It is responsible for processing control, compensation and disturbance variables in order to have an optimal operation of the system.
* ***Chassis***: It is the structure on which the electronic and mechanical components of the robot are assembled.
* ***Motors***.
* ***Sensors***: They are devices which allow the controller to obtain electrical signals from the interaction of the robot with the environment that surrounds it.
*  ***Power source***.

## Clasification of mobile robots.
Mobile robots are classified according to the work enviroment and the type of devices used to do a task _(Devopedia, 2022)_ _(R. Ramirez, 2024)_.

*  ***Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs)***.
    - _E.g_: Supply equipment robots used for military applications.
*  ***Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)***.
    - _E.g_: Drones, Festo robotic seagull, etc.
*  ***Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs)***.
    - _E.g_: Investigation and exploration robots.
*  ***Wheeled robots also known as "Autonomous Intelligent Vehicles" (AIVs)***.
    - _E.g_: Kobuki, EV3, Grey Walter's tortoises, Kiwibot, etc. 
*  ***Legged robots***.
    - _E.g_: Eric (1928), Hexapod, Asimo, AIBO, etc.
