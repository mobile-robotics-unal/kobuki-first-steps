According to the ISO 8373:2012 standard. It is a robot which can move under its own control with or without manipulators. These robots are considered within the group of _"Service robots"_, these robots perform useful tasks for humans and equipment, except industrial automation applications _(R. Ramirez, 2024)_.

These robots are used in areas such as agriculture, food and beverage industry, exploration, health care, etc _(Devopedia, 2022)_ _(R. Ramirez, 2024)_.

## Features of a mobile robot.
These are the basic features that a mobile robot must incorporate to optimize the system to perform a task _(Devopedia, 2022)_. 

* Wireless communication.
* Fleet management software.
* Fleet simulation software.
* Integration with supervisory software.
  
These characteristics are essential, since they allow a efficient control of the tasks performed by the robot, check the status of the robot and, if it is necessary, an emergency stop and even remote operation of the robot in case of a failure in the code to implement a task. These activities are possible by implementing the appropriate firmware, controllers, sensors, mechanisms, and different types of hardware.
