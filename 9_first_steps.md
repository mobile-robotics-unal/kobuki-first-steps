# It moves!!!

<!-- Programa simple de movimientos: Utilizando las herramientas propias del robot, crear un programa
sencillo que indique movimientos básicos del robot, como desplazarse hacia adelante, girar a la dere-
cha, etc.

The ROS wrapper comes with a simple program that allows the robot to be teleoperated.


Below, there is a brief video of the robot after connecting via USB and using the ROS Noetic framework. The status of the sensors were checked and a program was executed which allowed the system to be teleoperated with the computer keyboard.
As a clarification, this is part of the development of laboratory guide 2b.

The previous activities were carried out in the _"Automation and Machines Laboratory"_, and the _" 
Machines and Tools"_ Laboratory of ***Universidad Nacional de Colombia - Sede Bogotá*** (Mechanical and Mechatronics Engineeering Department).
