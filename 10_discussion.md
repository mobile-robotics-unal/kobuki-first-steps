This first lab intended for familiarizing the students and teaching them the main topics to consider when interacting with a mobile robotic platform prove essential. As we learned about the capabilities and limitations a mobile platform can impose over robotics application we might want to build on top of.

The main conclusions drawn from this experience are as follows:

- The importance of software and the support given to the  mobile platform you intent to use. As it woud aid or block the development process. 

- The crusial role of having an understanding of the main physical characteristics of a platform and its interaction with sensor as a good indicator of it capabilites.

- the exercise provided a great exploration of the kobuki platform and different ways to start the development.
