# Status and overall condition of the plaform

<!--
TODO:
estado actual del robot y sistema de control.
-->
One of the most important aspects before working with a robot such as this, is to identify the current state of the equipment. For this special case, the following was checked:

* Robot chasis.
* Motors.
* Suspension mechanisms.
* Control system.
* Sensors (firstly physical conditions).

The team did a general check up of the ***Kobuki bot - Luna***, the porpouse of the general check up was identify each section of the robot as chasis, motors, sensors, etc. In the next image, the reader of this repositorie could apreciate the general condition of ***Kobuki bot - Luna***.

In the inspection, the Kobuki was classified as a ***mobile robot with differential drive wheels with two free wheels***. This differential traction means that the control system allows the independent movement of each of the wheels, thus guaranteeing the description of different trajectories on the plane. Also this robot or robotic base has a structurally coupled base on which different elements such as auxiliary sensors and laptops can be supported.
The next step in the review was to verify the physical state of each part of the robot and also if the ***Kobuki - Lunabot*** could move with its default program, for this it was necessary to run a default walking mode built into the Kobuki firmware _(R. Ramirez, P. CÃ¡rdenas, 2024)_.

## Chasis condition.
