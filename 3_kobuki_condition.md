TODO:
estado actual del robot y sistema de control.

One of the most important aspects before working with a robot such as this, is to identify the current state of the equipment. For this special case, the following was checked:

* Robot chasis.
* Motors.
* Suspension mechanisms.
* Control system ( in this case the team did a test which is explained in a forward section of this section).
* Sensors (firstly physical conditions).

The team did a general check up of the ***Kobuki bot***, the porpouse of the general check up was identify each one of the sections of the robot as chasis, motors, sensors, etc.
